# mcp-wire — Implementation Plan

## Overview

**mcp-wire** is a CLI tool written in Go that lets users install and configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers across multiple AI coding CLI tools (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, etc.) from a single interface.

The architecture has two dimensions:

- **Services**: what to install (e.g., Sentry, Jira, Stripe). Defined as YAML files — no Go code needed to add one.
- **Targets**: where to install (e.g., Claude Code, Codex). Each target is a Go implementation that knows how to read/write that tool's config file.

The CLI combines the two: the user picks a service, the tool resolves credentials, and writes the config into one or more targets.

Interaction modes:

- **Guided mode (default)**: running `mcp-wire` with no subcommand starts an interactive menu/wizard for common workflows.
- **Explicit mode (advanced/CI)**: command-based syntax (for example `mcp-wire install <service> --target <slug> --no-prompt`) remains fully supported for scripting.

UX principle:

- Optimize for users who do not remember command syntax.
- At the end of guided flows, print the equivalent explicit command for reproducibility.

## Phase 1: Core Data Model

### 1.1 — Service Definition (YAML schema)

Create `internal/service/service.go` with the struct that maps to service YAML files.

```go
type Service struct {
    Name        string    `yaml:"name"`
    Description string    `yaml:"description"`
    Transport   string    `yaml:"transport"` // "sse" or "stdio"
    URL         string    `yaml:"url,omitempty"`         // for SSE transport
    Command     string    `yaml:"command,omitempty"`     // for stdio transport
    Args        []string  `yaml:"args,omitempty"`        // for stdio transport
    Env         []EnvVar  `yaml:"env,omitempty"`
}

type EnvVar struct {
    Name        string `yaml:"name"`
    Description string `yaml:"description"`
    Required    bool   `yaml:"required"`
    SetupURL    string `yaml:"setup_url,omitempty"`
    SetupHint   string `yaml:"setup_hint,omitempty"`
}
```

A service YAML file looks like this:

```yaml
name: sentry
description: "Sentry error tracking MCP"
transport: sse
url: "https://mcp.sentry.dev/sse"
env:
  - name: SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
    description: "Sentry authentication token"
    required: true
    setup_url: "https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/"
    setup_hint: "Create a token with project:read and event:read scopes"
```

```yaml
name: context7
description: "Context7 documentation lookup MCP"
transport: sse
url: "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
env: []
```

```yaml
name: filesystem
description: "Local filesystem access MCP"
transport: stdio
command: npx
args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/user/projects"]
env: []
```

### 1.2 — Service Registry

Create `internal/service/registry.go`.

This module discovers and loads all `.yaml` files from the `services/` directory. It should:

1. Accept a base path (default: `services/` relative to the binary, but also support `~/.config/mcp-wire/services/` for user-added definitions).
2. Read each `.yaml` file and unmarshal into a `Service` struct.
3. Validate required fields (name, transport, and either url or command depending on transport).
4. Return a map of `name → Service`.
5. If two files define the same `name`, the user-local one takes precedence.

Key function signatures:

```go
func LoadServices(paths ...string) (map[string]Service, error)
func ValidateService(s Service) error
```

### 1.3 — Target Interface

Create `internal/target/target.go`.

```go
type Target interface {
    // Name returns the human-readable name (e.g., "Claude Code")
    Name() string

    // Slug returns the CLI-friendly identifier (e.g., "claude")
    Slug() string

    // IsInstalled checks if this CLI tool is present on the system
    IsInstalled() bool

    // Install writes the service config into this target's config file.
    // resolvedEnv contains env var names mapped to their resolved values.
    Install(svc service.Service, resolvedEnv map[string]string) error

    // Uninstall removes the service config from this target's config file.
    Uninstall(serviceName string) error

    // List returns the names of currently configured MCP services in this target.
    List() ([]string, error)
}
```

### 1.4 — Target Registry

Create `internal/target/registry.go`.

A simple slice of all known targets. On startup, iterate and call `IsInstalled()` to determine which are available.

```go
func AllTargets() []Target
func InstalledTargets() []Target
func FindTarget(slug string) (Target, bool)
```

---

## Phase 2: Target Implementations

Each target follows the same pattern: locate the config file, read it as JSON (preserving unknown keys), add/remove the MCP entry, write it back.

**Critical rule**: always preserve unknown keys. Use `map[string]any` or `json.RawMessage` when reading config files. Never deserialize into a strict struct that would drop fields the user set manually.

### 2.1 — Claude Code Target

Create `internal/target/claude.go`.

Config file location: `~/.claude/settings.json` (global) or `.claude/settings.json` (project-local). Start with global only.

Config structure (relevant portion):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sentry": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://mcp.sentry.dev/sse",
      "env": {
        "SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN": "the-token-value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For stdio-based services:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/user/projects"]
    }
  }
}
```

Implementation:

- `IsInstalled()`: check if `claude` binary is in PATH (use `exec.LookPath`).
- `Install()`: read `~/.claude/settings.json` → unmarshal to `map[string]any` → add entry under `mcpServers` → write back with `json.MarshalIndent`. Create the file/directory if it doesn't exist.
- `Uninstall()`: same flow, delete the key from `mcpServers`.
- `List()`: read `mcpServers` keys.

### 2.2 — Codex Target

Create `internal/target/codex.go`.

Before implementing, research the current Codex CLI config file location and format. As of early 2025, Codex uses `~/.codex/config.json` or similar. The MCP server config structure needs to be verified.

**Action**: search for the Codex CLI documentation or config format before implementing. The structure is likely similar to Claude Code but may differ in key names or nesting.

Implementation follows the same pattern as Claude Code.

### 2.3 — Future Targets (not in v0.1)

Each of these would be a new file in `internal/target/`:

- `geminicli.go` — Gemini CLI
- `opencode.go` — OpenCode

Research their config formats when adding support. Each should take roughly 50-100 lines of Go following the established pattern.

---

## Phase 3: Credential Resolution

### 3.1 — Credential Source Interface

Create `internal/credential/resolver.go`.

```go
type Source interface {
    Name() string
    Get(envName string) (string, bool)
    Store(envName string, value string) error // may return ErrNotSupported
}

type Resolver struct {
    sources []Source
}

// Resolve tries each source in order. Returns the value and which source it came from.
func (r *Resolver) Resolve(envName string) (value string, source string, found bool)
```

Resolution order:

1. Environment variable (highest priority — user explicitly set it)
2. File store (`~/.config/mcp-wire/credentials`)
3. Not found → trigger interactive prompt

### 3.2 — Environment Source

Create `internal/credential/env.go`.

Simple wrapper around `os.Getenv`. `Store()` returns `ErrNotSupported`.

### 3.3 — File Source

Create `internal/credential/file.go`.

Reads/writes `~/.config/mcp-wire/credentials` in a simple `KEY=VALUE` format (one per line). This file should be created with `0600` permissions.

Format:

```
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=snt_abc123...
JIRA_API_TOKEN=jira_xyz789...
```

On `Get()`: read the file, parse lines, return matching value.
On `Store()`: read the file, update or append the key, write back.

### 3.4 — Interactive Credential Flow

This lives in the install command logic (not in the credential package). When a required env var is not found by the resolver:

1. Print the env var name, description, and why it is needed.
2. If `setup_url` is provided, print it and offer to open in browser (use `open` / `xdg-open` / `start` depending on OS).
3. If `setup_hint` is provided, print it.
4. Show progress when multiple credentials are required (example: `1/2`, `2/2`).
5. Prompt the user to paste the value (mask input for security).
6. Ask where to store: file store or skip (manage manually).
7. If file store chosen, call `source.Store()`.

Example output:

```
🔧 Configuring: Sentry error tracking MCP

  SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN is required.
  → Create one here: https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
    Tip: Create a token with project:read and event:read scopes

  Open URL in browser? [Y/n]: y

  Paste your token: ****************************

  Save to mcp-wire credential store? [Y/n]: y
  ✓ Saved

  Installing to: Claude Code, Codex
  ✓ Claude Code — configured
  ✓ Codex — configured
```

---

## Phase 4: CLI Commands

Use `github.com/spf13/cobra` for command structure.

### 4A — Guided Interactive UX (high priority)

#### 4A.1 — Main interactive entry (`mcp-wire`)

When the user runs `mcp-wire` with no subcommand, open an interactive menu:

1. Install a service
2. Uninstall a service
3. Show status
4. List services
5. List targets
6. Exit

#### 4A.2 — Install wizard flow

1. **Service selection**
   - Show a searchable/filterable list (name + description).
   - Support quick search by substring.
2. **Target selection**
   - Show detected installed targets first.
   - Allow multi-select.
3. **Credential step (for each required env var)**
   - Show description.
   - Show setup URL and ask whether to open it.
   - Show setup hint/scopes.
   - Prompt with masked input.
   - Ask whether to save in credential store.
4. **Confirmation step**
   - Show selected service, targets, and credential source summary.
5. **Apply + results**
   - Print per-target success/failure.
   - Print equivalent explicit command.

#### 4A.3 — Uninstall wizard flow

1. Service selection (searchable)
2. Target selection (multi-select)
3. Confirmation
4. Optional credential cleanup prompt

#### 4A.4 — Fallback behavior for explicit commands

- `mcp-wire install` with no service argument should enter the service picker.
- `mcp-wire uninstall` with no service argument should enter the service picker.
- Explicit args/flags continue to work unchanged.

### 4.1 — `mcp-wire list services`

List all available service definitions found in the services directory.

Output:

```
Available services:

  sentry       Sentry error tracking MCP
  jira         Jira project management MCP (Atlassian)
  context7     Context7 documentation lookup MCP
  filesystem   Local filesystem access MCP
```

### 4.2 — `mcp-wire list targets`

List all known targets and whether they are detected on this system.

Output:

```
Targets:

  claude       Claude Code   ✓ installed
  codex        Codex CLI     ✓ installed
  geminicli    Gemini CLI    ✗ not found
  opencode     OpenCode      ✗ not found
```

### 4.3 — `mcp-wire install <service>`

Flags:

- `--target <slug>` — install to a specific target only (can be repeated). Default: all installed targets.
- `--no-prompt` — fail if credentials are not already resolved (for CI/scripting).

Flow:

1. Load the service definition by name.
2. If `<service>` is omitted, enter interactive service selection.
3. For each required env var, run the credential resolver.
4. If not found and `--no-prompt` is not set, run the interactive prompt (Phase 3.4).
5. If not found and `--no-prompt` is set, exit with error.
6. For each target (filtered by `--target` or all installed), call `target.Install()`.
7. Print results.

### 4.4 — `mcp-wire uninstall <service>`

Flags:

- `--target <slug>` — same as install.

Flow:

1. For each target, call `target.Uninstall(serviceName)`.
2. If `<service>` is omitted, enter interactive service selection.
3. Optionally ask if the user wants to remove stored credentials for this service.

### 4.5 — `mcp-wire status`

Show a matrix of services × targets.

Output:

```
                Claude Code    Codex
  sentry        ✓              ✓
  jira          ✓              ✗
  context7      ✗              ✗
```

Implementation: for each installed target, call `target.List()` and cross-reference with known services.

---

## Phase 5: Initial Service Definitions

Create YAML files in the `services/` directory for at least these services:

### sentry.yaml

```yaml
name: sentry
description: "Sentry error tracking MCP"
transport: sse
url: "https://mcp.sentry.dev/sse"
env:
  - name: SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
    description: "Sentry authentication token"
    required: true
    setup_url: "https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/"
    setup_hint: "Create a token with project:read and event:read scopes"
```

### jira.yaml

```yaml
name: jira
description: "Jira project management MCP (Atlassian)"
transport: sse
url: "https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse"
env:
  - name: JIRA_API_TOKEN
    description: "Atlassian API token"
    required: true
    setup_url: "https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens"
    setup_hint: "Create an API token from your Atlassian account settings"
```

### context7.yaml

```yaml
name: context7
description: "Context7 documentation lookup MCP"
transport: sse
url: "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
env: []
```

### Research needed for additional services

Before writing more service definitions, verify the current MCP configuration format for each service. The URLs and env var names above are based on known configurations as of early 2025 and should be verified against current documentation.

---

## Phase 6: Build, Test, Release

### 6.1 — Go Module Setup

```
go mod init github.com/<your-username>/mcp-wire
go get github.com/spf13/cobra
go get gopkg.in/yaml.v3
```

No other external dependencies should be needed for v0.1.

### 6.2 — Testing Strategy

- **Service loading**: test YAML parsing with valid and invalid files, test validation logic, test precedence when multiple paths are provided.
- **Target implementations**: test Install/Uninstall/List against temporary config files. Create a temp dir, write a sample config, run the operation, assert the result.
- **Credential resolver**: test the chain order (env takes precedence over file), test the file store read/write.
- **Integration test**: write a test that loads a service YAML, creates a temp config file, runs Install, reads back the config, and verifies the MCP entry is correct.
- **Guided interactive flow tests**: test menu navigation, service search/filter behavior, target multi-select, and credential prompt flow using mocked input/output streams.
- **Sandboxed CLI integration tests**: run end-to-end install/status/uninstall flows in temporary HOME/PATH to avoid touching user config.
- **Manual QA checklist**: test on a machine with existing MCP configs and a clean machine; verify no unrelated config keys are removed.

### 6.3 — Build

Standard Go cross-compilation:

```bash
# Local
go build -o mcp-wire .

# Cross-compile
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o mcp-wire-darwin-arm64 .
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o mcp-wire-linux-amd64 .
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o mcp-wire-windows-amd64.exe .
```

### 6.4 — Release

Use GoReleaser or GitHub Actions for automated releases. Provide binaries for macOS (arm64 + amd64), Linux (amd64), and Windows (amd64). Consider a Homebrew tap for macOS users.

---

## Implementation Order

Implement in this exact order to have something working as early as possible:

1. **Go module + main.go + Cobra skeleton** — just `mcp-wire --help` works.
2. **Service struct + YAML loader + validation** — can parse service files.
3. **`list services` command** — first working command, proves the YAML loading.
4. **Target interface + Claude Code implementation** — can read/write Claude Code config.
5. **`list targets` command** — detects installed tools.
6. **Credential resolver (env + file sources)** — can resolve and store tokens.
7. **`install` command with interactive prompt** — the core feature, end-to-end flow.
8. **`uninstall` command** — straightforward once install works.
9. **`status` command** — reads from all targets, displays matrix.
10. **Codex target implementation** — second target, validates the abstraction.
11. **Initial service YAML files** — ship with 3-5 verified services.
12. **README, contributing guide** — explain how to add services and targets.
13. **Guided main menu** — `mcp-wire` with no args opens interactive navigation.
14. **Install wizard UX** — searchable service picker, target selection, credential guidance.
15. **Uninstall wizard parity** — same guided UX model as install.
16. **Interactive UX tests + sandbox integration tests** — prevent regressions in guided flows.
17. **Equivalent-command summary in guided mode** — print scriptable command at the end of each workflow.

---

## Design Decisions and Constraints

### Config file safety

When reading a target's config file, always use `map[string]any` (not a strict struct). This ensures that any keys the user added manually are preserved when mcp-wire writes back to the file. This is the single most important implementation detail — getting it wrong means the tool destroys user config.

### Service YAML as the contribution surface

The primary way community members contribute is by adding YAML files to `services/`. This must require zero Go knowledge. The YAML schema should be well-documented in CONTRIBUTING.md with examples for both SSE and stdio transports.

### Credential storage is opt-in

The user is always asked before storing credentials to the file store. The `--no-prompt` flag makes credentials required from environment or file store (no interactive prompting), which is useful for CI/automation.

### No daemon, no server, no background process

mcp-wire is a pure CLI tool. It reads files, writes files, and exits. No running processes, no state between invocations beyond the credential file and the target config files.

### Embedded vs external service definitions

For v0.1, service YAML files are shipped alongside the binary (in the repo). The tool looks for them relative to the binary location and also in `~/.config/mcp-wire/services/`. This avoids any network dependency. A future version could fetch definitions from a remote registry.

---

## Phase 7: Official MCP Registry Integration (feature-gated, incremental)

This phase adds optional integration with the Official MCP Registry (`https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`) without changing the current safe defaults.

### 7.0 — Product guardrails (lock these first)

- **Curated stays default**: mcp-wire bundled/user YAML services remain the default discovery/install source.
- **Registry is opt-in**: registry support is disabled by default behind a one-time local setting until the feature is stable.
- **No hidden references when disabled**: if registry is disabled, do not show registry flags/options/help/menu entries anywhere.
- **Latest-only selection**: when a user selects a registry MCP, resolve details from the `latest` version only.
- **Runtime checks are warnings by default**: missing package managers should warn, not block installation.

### 7.1 — Feature gate and local settings

Add mcp-wire local settings file (for example `~/.config/mcp-wire/config.json`) with:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "registry_enabled": false
  }
}
```

Suggested commands:

- `mcp-wire feature enable registry`
- `mcp-wire feature disable registry`
- `mcp-wire feature list` (optional but useful)

Acceptance criteria:

- Fresh install behavior is unchanged.
- With `registry_enabled=false`, all commands and guided flows behave exactly as today.

### 7.2 — Official registry API client (read-only)

Create `internal/registry/` for typed API client logic.

Use these endpoints:

- List latest servers: `GET /v0.1/servers?version=latest&limit=...&cursor=...`
- Search latest servers: `GET /v0.1/servers?version=latest&search=...`
- Get selected server details (latest only): `GET /v0.1/servers/{serverName}/versions/latest`

Important details:

- URL-encode `serverName` path values (`/` must become `%2F`).
- Parse `application/problem+json` errors and return friendly messages.
- Do not expose historical version selection in this phase.

### 7.3 — Caching and indexing for responsive UX

Add a local cache/index (for example under `~/.cache/mcp-wire/`) to avoid network-per-keystroke UI.

Requirements:

- Cold sync with pagination from `version=latest` list endpoint.
- Incremental sync using `updated_since`.
- Local in-memory filtering/search for interactive pickers.
- Graceful fallback to stale cache when network fails.

Acceptance criteria:

- Guided and non-guided search feel immediate.
- Registry API latency does not block every filter action.

### 7.4 — Unified catalog model with explicit source labels

Introduce an internal catalog type that supports both curated and registry entries.

Each entry should carry source metadata:

- `source: curated` (maintained/tested by mcp-wire)
- `source: registry` (from Official MCP Registry, not vetted by mcp-wire)

Keep existing `service.Service` and YAML format intact for curated entries.

### 7.5 — Source selection in explicit CLI mode

When registry is enabled, add source filtering:

- `--source curated|registry|all` (default: `curated`)

Apply this to:

- `mcp-wire list services`
- install flows that pick services interactively

When registry is disabled:

- Do not expose `--source`.
- Do not mention registry in help/usage text.

### 7.6 — Guided UI changes (only when enabled)

Add a source step before service selection:

1. Curated services (recommended)
2. Registry services (community)
3. Both

If user selects "Both", show one merged searchable list with clear markers:

- `*` = curated by mcp-wire
- unmarked (or explicit label) = registry

Always print the legend near the list when markers are shown.

### 7.7 — Trust/safety messaging for registry entries

Before confirming installation of a registry entry, show a short summary:

- Source (`registry`)
- Install type (`remote` or `package`)
- Transport (`streamable-http`, `sse`, `stdio`)
- Required secrets/credentials
- Repository URL (if available)

Interactive mode should require explicit confirmation for registry entries.

### 7.8 — Install strategy (split delivery)

#### 7.8.1 — Remote-first support

First support registry entries that map cleanly to remote installs:

- `remotes` with `streamable-http` or `sse`
- URL/header variable prompting and substitution

#### 7.8.2 — Package support

Then support package-backed installs:

- `npm`, `pypi`, `oci`, `nuget`, `mcpb`
- map registry metadata into target-compatible stdio/local config

For selected registry MCPs, always fetch/install using latest details only (`versions/latest`).

### 7.9 — Runtime/package-manager preflight (warning-only default)

For package-backed installs, preflight-check required runtime commands (for example `npx`, `uvx`, `docker`, `bun`, `dnx`, `pipx`, `python3`).

Behavior:

- Default: warn and continue.
- Optional strict mode (for CI): fail fast when runtime is missing (for example `--strict-runtime-check`).

### 7.10 — Status/uninstall parity for mixed sources

Ensure `status` and `uninstall` handle registry-installed services as first-class entries, not only curated YAML service names.

Requirements:

- Status should not hide registry-installed entries.
- Uninstall should work by installed service key regardless of source.

### 7.11 — Incremental implementation slices

Suggested order for shipping gradually:

1. Feature gate + settings file + no-registry-references enforcement.
2. Registry read client + latest-only detail lookup + basic tests.
3. Cache/index + local search.
4. `list services` source filter (`curated` default).
5. Guided UI source step and merged list markers.
6. Registry remote-install support.
7. Runtime preflight warnings.
8. Registry package-install support.
9. Status/uninstall parity for mixed sources.
10. Hardening, integration tests, docs.

---

## Future Roadmap (post v0.1)

These are features to consider after the core works. Not to be implemented now.

1. **Manifest file (`mcp-wire.yaml`)** — declare desired services in a file, run `mcp-wire apply` to sync all targets at once. Enables version-controlling your MCP setup.
2. **Target auto-detection improvements** — check config file existence in addition to binary presence, handle edge cases like Homebrew vs manual installs.
3. **OS keychain integration** — use `zalando/go-keyring` to store credentials in macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service / Windows Credential Manager instead of a plaintext file.
4. **`mcp-wire credentials list`** — show stored credentials (masked).
5. **`mcp-wire credentials rotate <service>`** — re-open setup URL, re-prompt, update all targets.
6. **Additional registry providers** — support third-party/private registries that implement the MCP Registry API, with per-registry trust controls.
